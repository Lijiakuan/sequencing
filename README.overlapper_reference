I think this works.
...
Kinda, but not really.
The existing references for Q20 and Q10 are just a compilation of
all of the existing overlappers.
The existing ALL reference has a bunch more though.  Not sure why.
Got it.  For some reason, the "original" version of ALL includes
those overlappers computed from when I grouped subjects.
Shouldn't've done that, but would've had no effect.




Use compile_all_overlappers.sh
NOT create_overlapper_references.sh
