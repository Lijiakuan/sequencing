# CCLS Sequencing

This is simply a collection of notes and scripts.

[RINS Package](http://khavarilab.stanford.edu/resources.html)

Eventually, I'd prefer to understand exactly what RINS and the
collection of apps that it uses does and then replicate in ruby
with testing.  RINS includes some examples, but none have
worked for me, so far.

Parameters have changed.  
Databases are corrupt.
Executables are seg faulting.
Processing "chopped" files finds nothing.
Parafly java crashes...



## TODO

Add testing.
