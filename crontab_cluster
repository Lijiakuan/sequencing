#	This will NOT SOURCE .bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile

#
#	I still don't get it.  I just doesn't always run.
#	Despite being set to run every 15 minutes, it only runs every 1:15??????  WTF?
#
#	I have noticed that multiple instances of fcron continue to exist?
#	Kinda like something is causing it to hang.  Commenting these out
#	until I can figure something out. Otherwise, just make it pop more
#	and stop worrying about it.

#	It is now my understanding that the cron job does not end until everything
#	is completed, even those things run in the background. Until then 
#	/var/log/cron will say "process already running:" and not start it again.
#	In theory, this is nice if you don't want multiple instances running.
#	However, if you don't care, what can you do?
#
#
#	It appears that having 2 entries in the crontab works.
#	80/hr.  500 in queue. ~6 hours. Run every 3 hours.

#	My prefered setup assuming that each job takes about an hour and 500 in the queue
#		( some of these hg19 blasts are taking over 3 hours. it'd be better 
#			to have a few more of these, but I'm just gonna let it go. )
