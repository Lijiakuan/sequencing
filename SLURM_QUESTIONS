calling "srun blastn ..... input file 1" works fine, however,

The number of times that we call it will cause us to run out of processes.

... so we are looking into using sbatch



Also, as when all of a given group of blastn runs are done, we want
to gather up all of the output.

srun doesn't seem to provide us with a way to know when they are all done.

... so we are looking into using sbatch



However, calling sbatch doesn't seem to allow us to srun commands on the entire cluster
like we would if we just called srun.

I added 

#SBATCH -N8

to the sbatch script and then called srun with these many options

srun -l --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --ntasks-per-core=1 

The first 8 calls seem to get scattered as the prefix on the output shows
different hostname output, 

0: n0000
0: n0001
0: n0002
0: n0003
0: n0004
0: n0005
0: n0006
0: n0007
0: n0000
0: n0000

but after that they are always n0000???

In addition, using the JOBID as a dependency doesn't seem to slow it down.
This is the last srun call, but it is the first to output. (the sleep scripts sleep first)

srun --nodes=1 --dependency=afterok:${SLURM_JOB_ID} echo "after all srun before wait" &



I was thinking that maybe we couldn't use the sbatch JOBID in the sbatch script so
I did a couple srun calls by hand on the command line and they seem to ignore it too



dependency is ignored when calling srun on command line and within sbatch file

--dependency=afterok:JOBID

second srun call starts immediately and runs for 20 seconds (the sleep time)

[jwendt@ec0000 ~]$ srun ./sleep_hostname.sh &
[1] 7991
[jwendt@ec0000 ~]$ sq
  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  46147   primary sleep_ho   jwendt  R       0:01      1 n0000
000 ~]$ srun ./sleep_hostname.sh --dependency=afterok:46147 &
[2] 8001
[jwendt@ec0000 ~]$ sq
  JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  46148   primary sleep_ho   jwendt  R       0:00      1 n0000
  46147   primary sleep_ho   jwendt  R       0:11      1 n0000




==================================================

SOLUTIONS

the dependency options MUST BE BEFORE THE COMMAND when calling srun!

it also appears that the sbatch script cannot use its own SLURM_JOB_ID
as dependencies for other submitted jobs

I am writing a script that calls one sbatch and captures its job id,
and then calls another sbatch with the previous as a dependency.

	command="sbatch -J FIRST sbatch_sleep_script.sh"
	latest_id=$( $command 2>&1 >/dev/null | awk ' { print $5 }' )
	command="sbatch -J SECOND --dependency=afterok:$latest_id sbatch_sleep_script.sh"
	echo $command
	latest_id=$( $command 2>&1 >/dev/null | awk ' { print $5 }' )	#	don't really need this latest_id
