24 GB on 6 machines. 16GB on n0004 and n0005. If you need big memory you
need to parallelize and not run embarressingly parallel processes, see
https://genepi1.berkeley.edu/cluster/

yes, but I don't support it, just bash. The cluster has aged so dont
expect the most current tcsh or bash. I need to rebuild, but my cluster
software isn't being supported. Need a big block of time to move to
other software.

n0 is a 8 cpu, 24GB memory fat machine.

ec is a cluster of 8 machines, plus the head node (don't run anything on
the head node, use slum command to submit more to the other 8 (52
jobslots). https://genepi1.berkeley.edu/cluster/ has doc you should
review before anything else.
