Taxonomy names file (names.dmp):

	name_txt				-- name itself
	unique name				-- the unique variant of this name if name not unique
	name class				-- (synonym, common name, ...)

blastdbcmd should also provide this info, but using %T or others simply causes it
to respond with many, many "Error: Taxonomic database was not found." and I have
no idea how to provide it.  I think that these fields are simply not included in the
nt database. Actually, it was the %L and %S causing the error.


> blastdbcmd -db /Volumes/cube/working/indexes/nt -entry all -outfmt '%a,%g,%T'

would yield a very long list of what I'm looking for and will no longer need
the gi2taxid tool


...from the manual ...

5.4 Extract all human sequences from the nr database

Although one cannot select GIs by taxonomy from a database, a combination of unix command line tools will accomplish this:

$ blastdbcmd -db nr -entry all -outfmt "%g %T" | \ awk ' { if ($2 == 9606) { print $1 } } ' | \ blastdbcmd -db nr -entry_batch - -out human_sequences.txt

The first blastdbcmd invocation produces 2 entries per sequence (GI and taxonomy ID), the awk command selects from the output of that command those sequences which have a taxonomy ID of 9606 (human) and prints its GIs, and finally the second blastdbcmd invocation uses those GIs to print the sequence data for the human sequences in the nr database.

TaxonomyName
	id, tax_id, name_txt, name_unique, name_class

gi2TaxonomyName (join table) seems unnecessary.  could just put tax_id in Accession table
	gi, tax_id

Accession
	id, accession_number, gi, tax_id
